                    <br>The aim of the course is to train students in the mathematical concepts and process of algorithmic thinking, allowing them to build simpler, more efficient solutions to real-world computational problems by building on the principles of mathematics.
 
                    The course will enable the student to apply a wide range of existing algorithms and data structures for fundamental problems, as well as general methods for developing new algorithms and mathematical tools for analyzing the correctness and efficiency of algorithms. This is of paramount importance for the ability to develop efficient software, and is central to the understanding of upper and lower bounds for computational problems.
                     
                    In relation to the competence profile of the Software Technology programme it is the explicit focus of the course to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Give the competence to apply new variants of central algorithms and data structures developed within software technology.</li>
                        <li>Give skills to analyse pros and cons of algorithms, in particular with respect to the use of resources.</li>
                        <li>Give knowledge and understanding of a selection of core algorithms and data structures developed within software technology.</li>
                </ul>
